# module-6-challenge

#This is a yet to be finished file, but it's meant to fulfill the following Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

I have no clue what's happening when attempting to open the website on some non-chrome browser that it just won't work, but this is a screenshot of what I managed to accomplish this far:

As I said, the website is not completed, though It will be soon. I will just catch up w the modules I have w lower grades this incoming week and then will be set to finish this one as well.
Thanks for the patience!
